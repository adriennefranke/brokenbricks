The Big Three Killed My Baby

The big three killed my baby
No money in my hand again
The big three killed my baby
Nobody's coming home again

Their ideas made me want to spit
A hundred dollars goes down the pit
30,000 wheels are rollin'
And my stick shift hands are swollen
Everything involved is shady
The big three killed my baby

The big three killed my baby
No money in my hand again
The big three killed my baby
Nobody's coming home again

Why dont you take the day off and try to repair
A billion others dont seem to care
Better ideas are stuck in the mud
The motors runnin' on tuckers blood
Don't let them tell you the future's electric
Cause gasolines not measured in metric
30,000 wheels are spinnin'
And oil company faces are grinnin'
Now my hands are turnin' red
And I found out my baby is dead

The big three killed my baby
No money in my hand again
The big three killed my baby
Nobody's coming home again

Well I've said it now, nothing's changed
People are burnin' for pocket change
And creative minds are lazy
And the big three killed my baby

And my baby's my common sense
So dont feed me planned obsolescence
Yeah my baby's my common sense
So dont feed my planned obsolescence
I'm about to have another blowout
I'm about to have another blowout


Suzy Lee

There's a story
I would like to tell
My problem is
It's one you know too well
It's one you know too well

Me Suzy Lee
The one I'm speaking of
The question is
Is she the one I love?
Is she the one I love?

All right
Is she the one I love?

She'll send me flowers
With her tears bored inside
And you know what I'd do
I would run and hide
I would run and hide

And the paper
On it was my name
With the question
Do you feel the same?
Do you feel the same?

To end this tale
The one I'm speaking of
I wish I have an answer, but I don't know)
Is this really love?
Is this really love?

Is this really love?


Sugar Never Tasted So Good

Sugar never tasted so good
Sugar never tasted so good
Sugar never tasted good to me
Yeah

Until her eyes crossed over
Until her mind crossed over
Until her soul fell next to me

Now
If the wrinkle that is in your brain
Has given you quite a steam
Your fingers have become a crane
Pulling on these puppet strings

Yeah

What a feeling that's begun
What a feeling that's begun

What a feeling that's begun
What a feeling that's begun

I felt just like a baby
Until I held a baby
What a mood this boy can be

Yeah

And her thougths like a daisy
How my mind gets lazy
I must've been crazy not to see

Alright

If the wrinkle that is in your brain
Has given you quite a steam
Your fingers have become a crane
Your fingers have become a crane
Your fingers have become a crane
Pulling on these puppet strings

Water never tasted so good
Water never tasted so good
Water never tasted good to me


Wasting My Time

And if I'm wasting my time
Then nothing could be better
Than hanging on the line
And waiting for an honest word forever

And if you're saying goodbye
Please don't you think me bitter
For recalling every rhyme
From the book the page
The line the word the letter

Well the windows turning blue
And the waters ever flowing
And i hope i'm not a fool
For laughing at myself
As you are going


Astro

One, two, three, four

Maybe Jasper does the astro
Maybe Jasper does the astro
Maybe Jasper does the astro, astro

Yeah

Maybe Lilly does the astro
Maybe Lilly does the astro
Maybe Lilly does the astro, astro

Whoo, hey

Maybe Jackson does the astro
Maybe Jackson does the astro
Maybe Jackson does the astro, astro hey

Maybe Momma does the astro
Maybe Momma does the astro
Maybe Momma does the astro, astro

Maybe Tesla does the astro
Maybe Tesla does the astro
Maybe Edison is AC/DC


Broken Bricks

Well, have you been to the broken bricks, girl?
Snuck down through the cyclone fence
Past the caution tape and the security gate
Backwards to the break room bench

Well, there was a little corner where you first got kissed
And felt your boyfriend's fist and made the company list
And there's a little spot where your dad ate lunch
And your brother landed his first punch, yeah, yeah, yeah

Well, now you've been to the broken bricks, girl
Seen the barrels that they've left behind
Seen the machine that got aluminum clean
And cut tape from the caution sign
I've broken two window panes
Just a rusty colored rain that drives a man insane
You tried jump over water but you land in oil
Climbed the metal of a broken crane, yeah, yeah, yeah

Don't go to the broken bricks, girl
It's not a place that you want to be
Think about the spot your father spent his life
Demolition calls it building C
Demolition calls it building C, now
Demolition calls it building C, now, yeah


When I Hear My Name

when I hear my name I want to disappear
when I hear my name I want to disappear
Oh oh oh oh
When I see my face I want to disappear
When I see my face I want to disappear
Oh oh oh oh


Do

Well somebody walked up to me
But I didn't know what to do
And then somebody said hello to me
But I didn't know what to do
Because I think that my words could get
Twisted so i bend my back over take a
Gulp be funny cause I know there's nothing I can do

Then my mother tried to pick me up
When I was sittin' down on the ground
Something forced my little eyes come open
But I couldn't make out the sound
It doesn't matter cause my eyes are lying
And they don't have emotion
Don't wanna be social, can't take it when they hate me
But I know there's nothing I can do

When my thoughts start to feel like mine
They're taken from me it seems to happen
All the time, every time
And the feelings that are fine for you
There's somebody there
Who doesn't think they are true
So think of something new
There's nothing left to do

And then my idols walk next to me
I look up at them they fade away
it's a destruction of a mystery
the more i listen to what they say
so does that mean that there's no more doin'
and there's no more thinkin'
and there's no more feeling
cause there's no right opinion
so can you tell me what i'm supposed to do


Screwdriver

Tuesday morning now
I gotta have somewhere to go
I call up tommy now
I call him on the telephone
Won't you wake up and come with me now
I'm going to the pawn and loan
Walking down thirty three
Walking on thirty o

Well what am I supposed to think
I drop a nickel in the sink
I love people like a brother now
But I'm not gonna be their mother now
What if someone walked up to me
And like an apple cut right through me
I'm not gonna stand there grinnin
'Cause I'm not the one who's sinnin

Screwdriver
Now that you have heard my story now
I've got a little ending to it now
Whenever you go out alone
Take a little dog a bone
Think about your little sister
Then you got to drive it home
With a screwdriver

I got a little feeling goin' now
I got a little feeling goin' now


Little People

There's a little girl who says bing bing bomb
There's a little girl who says bing bing bomb, hello
There's a little boy with a spider in his hand
There's a little boy with a spider in his hand, hello

There's a little girl with the red shoes on
There's a little girl with the red shoes on, hello
There's a little boy with twenty five cents
There's a little boy with twenty five cents, hello

And there's a little girl with a tiger on her bed
There's a little girl with a tiger on her bed, hello
There's a little boy with nothin' on his mind
There's a little boy with nothin' on his mind, hello


Slicker Drips

They're lookin' at me
No where to go
And what they're sayin'
Just don't know
Floor below me
Ceiling above
I'm in the middle
Nobody to love

They're lookin' at me
No where to go
And what they're sayin'
You just don't know
Floor below you now
Ceiling above
You're in the middle
Nobody to love
Nobody to love
Yeah


I Fought Piranhas

Well I hold the rope
And I hold the sail
And I kept my papers
To keep from land in jail
And I fought piranhas
And I fought the cold
There was noone with me
I was all alone

Well it's Easter morning now
And there's noone around
So I unroll the cement
And walk into the town
There was noone with me
And I was all alone
And I fought piranhas
And I fought the cold

Well you know what it's like
I don't got to tell you
Who puts up a fight
Walking out of hell now
When you fought piranhas
And you fought the cold
There's nobody with you
And you're all alone
